# orb_detector
The implementation of part of the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) pipeline. The ORB consists of the feature detector and feature descriptor that detect and describe reproducible and discriminative regions in an image. Those, in turn, can be matched between pairs of images for correspondence search, 3D reconstruction, and so on.
